class TreeClass(metaclass=TreeClassMeta):
    """Convert a class to a pytree by inheriting from :class:`.TreeClass`.

    A pytree is any nested structure of containers and leaves. A container is
    a pytree can be a container or a leaf. Container examples are: a ``tuple``,
    ``list``, or ``dict``. A leaf is a non-container data structure like an
    ``int``, ``float``, ``string``, or ``Array``. :class:`.TreeClass` is a
    container pytree that holds other pytrees in its attributes.

    Note:
        :class:`.TreeClass` is immutable by default. This means that setting or
        deleting attributes after initialization is not allowed. This behavior
        is intended to prevent accidental mutation of the tree. All tree modifications
        on `TreeClass` are out-of-place. This means that **all** tree modifications
        return a new instance of the tree with the modified values.

        There are two ways to set or delete attributes after initialization:

        1. Using :attr:`.at` property to modify an *existing* leaf of the tree.

           >>> import sepes as sp
           >>> class Tree(sp.TreeClass):
           ...     def __init__(self, leaf: int):
           ...         self.leaf = leaf
           >>> tree = Tree(leaf=1)
           >>> new_tree = tree.at["leaf"].set(100)
           >>> tree is new_tree  # new instance is created
           False

        2. Using :attr:`.at[mutating_method_name]` to call a *mutating* method
           and apply the mutation on a *copy* of the tree. This option allows
           writing methods that mutate the tree instance but with these updates
           applied on a copy of the tree.

           >>> import sepes as sp
           >>> class Tree(sp.TreeClass):
           ...     def __init__(self, leaf: int):
           ...         self.leaf = leaf
           ...     def add_leaf(self, name:str, value:int) -> None:
           ...         # this method mutates the tree instance
           ...         # and will raise an `AttributeError` if called directly.
           ...         setattr(self, name, value)
           >>> tree = Tree(leaf=1)
           >>> # now lets try to call `add_leaf` directly
           >>> tree.add_leaf(name="new_leaf", value=100)  # doctest: +SKIP
           Cannot set attribute value=100 to `key='new_leaf'`  on an immutable instance of `Tree`.
           >>> # now lets try to call `add_leaf` using `at["add_leaf"]`
           >>> method_output, new_tree = tree.at["add_leaf"](name="new_leaf", value=100)
           >>> new_tree
           Tree(leaf=1, new_leaf=100)

           This pattern is useful to write freely mutating methods, but with
           The expense of having to call through `at["method_name"]` instead of
           calling the method directly.

    Note:
        ``sepes`` offers two methods to construct the ``__init__`` method:

        1. Manual ``__init__`` method

           >>> import sepes as sp
           >>> class Tree(sp.TreeClass):
           ...     def __init__(self, a:int, b:float):
           ...         self.a = a
           ...         self.b = b
           >>> tree = Tree(a=1, b=2.0)

        2. Auto generated ``__init__`` method from type annotations.

           Either by ``dataclasses.dataclasss`` or by using :func:`.autoinit` decorator
           where the type annotations are used to generate the ``__init__`` method
           similar to ``dataclasses.dataclass``. Compared to ``dataclasses.dataclass``,
           :func:`.autoinit`` with :func:`field` objects can be used to apply functions on
           the field values during initialization, support multiple argument kinds,
           and can apply functions on field values on getting the value.
           For more details see :func:`.autoinit` and :func:`.field`.

           >>> import sepes as sp
           >>> @sp.autoinit
           ... class Tree(sp.TreeClass):
           ...     a:int
           ...     b:float
           >>> tree = Tree(a=1, b=2.0)

    Note:
        Leaf-wise math operations are supported  using ``leafwise`` decorator.
        ``leafwise`` decorator adds ``__add__``, ``__sub__``, ``__mul__``, ... etc
        to registered pytrees. These methods apply math operations to each leaf of
        the tree. for example:

        >>> @sp.leafwise
        ... @sp.autoinit
        ... class Tree(sp.TreeClass):
        ...     a:int = 1
        ...     b:float = 2.0
        >>> tree = Tree()
        >>> tree + 1  # will add 1 to each leaf
        Tree(a=2, b=3.0)

    Note:
        Advanced indexing is supported using ``at`` property. Indexing can be
        used to ``get``, ``set``, or ``apply`` a function to a leaf or a group of
        leaves using ``leaf`` name, index or by a boolean mask.

        >>> @sp.autoinit
        ... class Tree(sp.TreeClass):
        ...     a:int = 1
        ...     b:float = 2.0
        >>> tree = Tree()
        >>> tree.at["a"].get()
        Tree(a=1, b=None)
        >>> tree.at[0].get()
        Tree(a=1, b=None)

    Note:
        - Under ``jax.tree_util.***`` or ``optree`` all :class:`.TreeClass`
          attributes are treated as leaves.
        - To hide/ignore a specific attribute from the tree leaves, during
          ``jax.tree_util.***`` operations, freeze the leaf using :func:`.freeze`
          or :func:`.tree_mask`.

        >>> # freeze(exclude) a leaf from the tree leaves:
        >>> import jax
        >>> import sepes as sp
        >>> @sp.autoinit
        ... class Tree(sp.TreeClass):
        ...     a:int = 1
        ...     b:float = 2.0
        >>> tree = Tree()
        >>> tree = tree.at["a"].apply(sp.freeze)
        >>> jax.tree_util.tree_leaves(tree)
        [2.0]

        >>> # undo the freeze
        >>> tree = tree.at["a"].apply(sp.unfreeze, is_leaf=sp.is_frozen)
        >>> jax.tree_util.tree_leaves(tree)
        [1, 2.0]

        >>> # using `tree_mask` to exclude a leaf from the tree leaves
        >>> freeze_mask = Tree(a=True, b=False)
        >>> jax.tree_util.tree_leaves(sp.tree_mask(tree, freeze_mask))
        [2.0]

    Note:
        - :class:`.TreeClass` inherits from ``abc.ABC`` meaning that it can `abc`
          features like ``@abc.abstractmethod`` can be used to define abstract
          behavior that can be implemented by subclasses.

    Warning:
        The structure should be organized as a tree. In essence, *cyclic references*
        are not allowed. The leaves of the tree are the values of the tree and
        the branches are the containers that hold the leaves.

            - ``AttributeError`` is raised, If a method that mutates the instance
              is called directly. Instead use ``at["method_name"]`` to call a method
              that mutates the instance.

            Building immutable chainable methods with ``at``:

            The following example shows how to build a chainable methods using
            ``at`` property. Note that while the methods are mutating the instance,
            the mutation is applied on a copy of the tree and the original tree
            is not mutated.
